In this repository we have tried to create a stocks portfolio by using Gurobi optimisation. Stock prices from the years 2019 and 2020 are taken where the 2019 data is our training data and 2020 is the testing data. The objective is to replicate the market with a limitation on the number of stocks present in the portfolio. This was achieved in 2 methods.
